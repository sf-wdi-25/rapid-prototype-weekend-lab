## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a rapid prototype that you can quickly test and experiment with, in preparation for your final project. Your app should solve a small, focused problem.

>  We strongly discourage you from using any code from this prototype in your final project!

## Use "Outside In"
It is good idea to build "from the outside, in" -- meaning you build out the frontend exactly the way you want it to look, before doing any work on the server. Using mock-data, your front end will both "look like" and "work like" a full-stack appliction.

This process helps a lot with freelance and contract work because your clients will get excited to see a prototype that is working and navigable. You haven't sunk much time into it, so if a client wants you to change something, it is easy to do!

**Focus on the frontend**:

Use HTML, CSS, and jQuery or Angular.

**Don't worry about the backend at first**:

You can stub out something basic if you have time. But start with hardcoded data.

## App Ideas

* <a href="http://josephrocca.com/startupideasgenerator" target="_blank">Startup Ideas Generator</a>
* A Stack Overflow clone with questions, answers, comments, and votes.
* A microblog, journal, or to do list.
* A "Yelp for" - create reviews about anything - yoga studios, online stores, toast, you name it.
* A flashcard app for studying, with decks of flash cards.
* A simple game
* Design Inspiration: http://www.csszengarden.com/
* Anything else you can think of!

## Optional: Stubbed Data

**JSON REST endpoints**

* [JSONPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) - RESTful API with mock JSON data)
* [Super CRUD](https://super-crud.herokuapp.com) - RESTful API with mock JSON data

## Stretch Features
This lab is a good opportunity to try out a new technology/tool/library you think you'd like to use in your final project.

* Use [angular-ui](https://angular-ui.github.io), or [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) for a UI component or feature.
    * Consider using a 3rd party jQuery plugin / angular module like autocomplete, drag and drop, infinite scroll, etc.
* Create and use a custom angular directive.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.
2. Create your front inside this directory, and edit the `README.md` to reflect what your project does.

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
